`createYear` creates a new year of source files and the library and unit test targets. Each day gets a file defining the input strings, a file with a single function each for each part of each day (basically `func part1()` and `func part2()`) and a file with a multiline comment to paste in the problem text. Then the test target has a separate file for each day containing a class with 4 test functions: parts 1 and 2 sample and real input.

`make init` to set up the dev env.
