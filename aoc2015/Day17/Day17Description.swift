## --- Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much ---

The elves bought too much eggnog again - `150` liters this time. To fit
it all into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller
containers. You take an inventory of the capacities of the available
containers.

For example, suppose you have containers of size `20`, `15`, `10`, `5`,
and `5` liters. If you need to store `25` liters, there are four ways to
do it:

-   `15` and `10`
-   `20` and `5` (the first `5`)
-   `20` and `5` (the second `5`)
-   `15`, `5`, and `5`

Filling all containers entirely, how many different *combinations of
containers* can exactly fit all `150` liters of eggnog?
